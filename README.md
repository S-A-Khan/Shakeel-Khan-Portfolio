### *A glimpse of the projects I've been working on*  


## [**Mar 2020: COVID-19 Analysis**](https://patientappointmentanalysis)
- Patient no-shows permeate medical practices, across specialties, locations, and practice models. No-shows consistently cause problems for practices and therefore practices track their no-show rate to realize the impact that no-shows can have on both their processes and their revenue. 
- There are many reasons that patients fail to make their appointments and there are demographic similarities across patients who no-show more consistently than others. 
- Using the appointment data provided from a medical practice create visualization using Power BI to gain insights and identify trends regarding appointments, no-shows and which variable is the most important one that affects patient show-up or no-show to the appointment.
