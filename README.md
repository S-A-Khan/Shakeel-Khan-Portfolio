## [**Mar 2020: COVID-19 Analysis**](https://patientappointmentanalysis)
- 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread has been occurring. 
- Johns Hopkins University developed a dashboard to track the progression of disease caused by Coronavirus referred as Covid-19. The dataset used for analysis is publically available and can be used to track daily level information with regards to number of case, deaths and recovery. 
- Using the dataset and tools such as Excel and Power BI I have developed real-time dashboards to visualize the data to study the progression of the disease.

## [**Nov 2019: Patient Appointment Analysis**](https://patientappointmentanalysis)
- Patient no-shows permeate medical practices, across specialties, locations, and practice models. No-shows consistently cause problems for practices and therefore practices track their no-show rate to realize the impact that no-shows can have on both their processes and their revenue.Â 
- There are many reasons that patients fail to make their appointments and there are demographic similarities across patients who no-show more consistently than others. 
- Using the appointment data provided from a medical practice create visualization and using Power BI I have developed online dashboards and reports to identify trends regarding appointments, no-shows and gain insights regarding variables that affects patient show-up or no-show to the appointment.
